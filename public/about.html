<p>I'm Jason Anonuevo — a husband and father of two. Previously, I worked as a Mainframe COBOL Developer and discovered a deep love for programming early on. Currently, I'm learning web development through Dr. Angela Yu's bootcamp—a well-structured program that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, deployment, and even Web3 technologies via hands-on projects and real-world examples 
 My ambition is to become proficient in web development and eventually design and build a future-proof website that can support and modernize our family business.</p>

 <p>Speaking of which, I now run a car accessories business. We sell through Shopee, TikTok, and Lazada, and we also operate a physical shop where we handle installations. We employ over 20 people, and both my wife and I play key roles: she serves as our CEO while I act as COO. I'm committed to scaling the business further, leveraging the web development skills I'm gaining to enhance our operations, marketing, and user experience.</p>

 <p>Learning under Angela Yu's guidance has given me a solid foundation, and although some parts of her curriculum may evolve over time, the emphasis on real-world coding and full-stack understanding remains highly relevant to my goals. I'm optimistic that combining my programming passion with our growing business will lead to innovative digital solutions and long-term success.</p>
